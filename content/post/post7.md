It's a little strange and sad to tell you this now. Maybe you won't even read it, maybe you won't even understand that it's about you, but... But I want to tell you about it.

Do you remember that day, it was quite recently, in late autumn? When the trees were already bare, and there was no snow yet, when an inexplicable longing took possession of the soul?

I console myself with the thought that you still do not forget that day.

I felt lousy. By that day, a huge number of problems were slowly and tastefully eating into my nerves. Everything fell out of my hands. Nothing was going the way I wanted, and the realization of my powerlessness made me want to cry.

Yes, then I cried.

Quietly, almost silently swallowing tears.

It was deep night outside.

And your call. He was a complete surprise to me. At first I didnâ€™t even believe it, I thought that it was a call by mistake, but no.

Simple conversation about nothing. Our clumsy attempts to strike up a conversation simply because hanging up after a few seconds was too weird. Your polite interest in my new life seemed to me just a nod to the fact that we used to get along well with each other.

When the conversation was already over, looking aimlessly at the white screen of the laptop, I felt how I felt better. For the first time after weeks of stress, I felt at least some hope.

For you it didn't cost anything, for me it didn't let me go crazy.
