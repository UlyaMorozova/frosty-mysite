Silence has a master

Before people could speak, they were silent. When they finally mastered the language fluently, the silence did not disappear.

As long as people remain silent, I will live.

I don't need offerings. I don't have to build temples and offer prayers. It's enough for me that you are silent.

Be silent when you do not know the answer, be silent when you are ashamed, be silent because there is nothing to say, be silent to avoid a quarrel.

Sometimes silence is more piercing and louder than any words. His hopeless cry echoes in an empty house, crashes against the wall of someone else's egoism, curls up in a tight spiral in the soul.

But silence can also be different: timid and shy, indecisive and fragile, calm and warm. Then silence can express that which cannot be put into words.

While people are talking, I, silence, will be there. Just as there is no light without shadow, so there is no sound without silence.
