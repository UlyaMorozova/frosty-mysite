For me, writing is not just a hobby, it's a way of expressing myself. When you are driven into the framework of society every day, you need at least something that will help you cope with everything.

Not so long ago I had drawing as an outlet, but for some reason I left it, which I still regret many times. Writing has replaced my previous way of escaping reality.
